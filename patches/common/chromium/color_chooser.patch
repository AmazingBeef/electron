Subject: color_chooser.patch

Disables a DCHECK that crashes the ColorChooser on Windows,
that DCHECK most likely is an artifact that remained in chromium from a
long time ago (last update of that part of the code was around 2012-2013,
and this is purely UI, I don't think they have automated tests for it).
